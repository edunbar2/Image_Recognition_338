# Image_Recognition_338
Welcome to the CSCI 338 final project repository for Artem, Eric, Charlie, and Luke. 
For our project we created a working neural network capable of classifying 10 types of animals.
Currently, our program can predict whether an image contains a cat, dog, sheep, chicken, cow, elephant, horse, spider,
or squirrel.

<br><br>In order to make this work our team used the Python programming language, utilizing Tensorflow for the
Neural network creation and training, and Tkinter for the UI. Since many of us were new to the Python language, this project
enabled us to expand our horizons, and pick up a valuable tool for any software developer.

<br><br>During the design and development phase of our project, several design patters were tried out. This allowed us as
a group to explore different ways to develop software, as well as learn how developing code in a group setting differs
from solo work. 

<br><br>In order to use this project you must copy the GitHub repository to an IDE and run it. As of now there is not an
executable to run, however this may change in the future. Once the code is downloaded simply change the paths to fit your 
OS and run the program. Inside the program, pick and image and click classify and the neural network will attempt to guess 
the image.
